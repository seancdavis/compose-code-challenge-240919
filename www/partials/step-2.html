    Now, let's enable and use a Netlify Extension in order to enter the
    competition and to reveal the next steps which will earn you more points for
    a better chance of winning.
  </p>
  <h3>Here's how:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install the
      <a
        href="https://app.netlify.com/extensions/compose-challenge-edge-includes"
        target="_blank"
      >
        <code>netlify-edge-includes-at-compose</code>
      </a>
      extension for your Netlify team.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once installed, you can use it on any of your sites. Enable it for this
      site from the Netlify UI under "Site configuration / General"
    </li>
    <li>
      The extension will let you inject content into your site via a component.
      Add the code shown below to this site's
      <span data-nf-enhance="repo-link-index.html">
        <code>index.html</code>
      </span>
      and push your changes to trigger another site deployment to to see the
      result.
      <pre><code>&lt;netlify-edge-include href=&quot;https://compose-challenge.netlify.app/partials/add-image-cdn&quot;&gt;&lt;/netlify-edge-include&gt;</code></pre>
    </li>
